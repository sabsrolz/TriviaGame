# TriviaGame

Description of the game:

Welcome to the Trivia game! The theme of this game is inventions around the world. There are a total of 8 questions in this game. Each question will have a timer that gives the player 10 seconds to answer the question. If the player selects the correct answer, a point is awarded, otherwise the player gets a loss. The correct answer will be displayed at the end of each question. The game will transition to the next question without user input. At the end of the 8 rounds, the player will have the option to play again by pressing on a reset button and the final score will be shown.

Technology used:

In this assignment, I created a Trivia game using JavaScript for the logic and jQuery to manipulate HTML. I integrated Gifs to my questions, through the GIPHY GET API using Jquery AJAX method. The Gifs that are displayed are queried from the output object by selecting index = 1 of the returned options.
